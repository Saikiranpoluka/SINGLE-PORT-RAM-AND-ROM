the design and implementation of Random Access Memory (RAM) and Read-Only Memory (ROM) using VERILOG .
RAM is a volatile memory type that supports both read and write operations, enabling quick data access essential for system performance.
In contrast, ROM is a non-volatile memory designed for permanent data storage, typically containing firmware or unchangeable software.
it describes the behavior and functionality of the ram and rom.
the importance of memory design in optimizing system performance and reliability.
